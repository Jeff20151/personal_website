<section class="course-body">
  <p><strong>BioDesign & Other Matters</strong> is a guided studio that invites high school makers to explore the world of biodesign. The program bridges living systems research with speculative narratives, asking participants to design futures that are both rigorous and empathetic.</p>
  <p>Across the semester, learners move between labs and community fieldwork. They experiment with biological materials, biodesign techniques, and narrative devices to translate insights into public prototypes. Rather than chasing quick solutions, teams stress-test ideas with mentors, iterate in material labs, and document each cycle.</p>
  <p>The cohort will develop signature projects to present at BioDesign Challenge 2026. Alumni receive ongoing mentorship for global showcases and university applications.</p>
