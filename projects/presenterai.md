<div class="page-body">
  <p>PresenterAI began as an internal tool for synthesizing lab notes into workshop-ready decks. The system ingests raw experimental logs, extracts the critical insights, and rewrites them for audiences ranging from investors to policy partners.</p>

  <h2>Scope</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Research interviews with faculty and founders on pitch pain points.</li>
    <li>No-code orchestration using GPT fine-tuning, Airtable, and a headless slide editor.</li>
    <li>Analytics loop measuring persuasion on demo days and online launches.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Whatâ€™s Next</h2>
  <p>I am building a bilingual template marketplace and automated visual styling so researchers can focus on storytelling rather than formatting.</p>
