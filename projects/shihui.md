<div class="page-body">
  <p>Shihui is a long-form experiment combining traditional carpentry, mycelium composites, and narrative retail. We partnered with local artisans to map their unmet needs and prototyped materials that reduce waste while keeping the original aesthetics.</p>

  <h2>Highlights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Field research with woodworkers in central Taiwan, capturing craft workflows.</li>
    <li>Material lab sprints to find bio-based substitutes for single-use structural pieces.</li>
    <li>Pop-up retail pilots measuring conversion across tourists and locals.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Impact</h2>
  <p>Shihui now informs the circular design guidelines I use when evaluating future physical-digital hybrid projects.</p>
