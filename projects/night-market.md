<div class="page-body">
  <p>This sprint explored how to package Taiwan’s culinary culture for a global audience. I designed tasting kits, scripted localized storytelling, and ran rapid ads to test willingness-to-pay in the US, Singapore, and Hong Kong.</p>

  <h2>Experiment Stack</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Signal mining via TikTok Creative Center and diaspora community groups.</li>
    <li>Shopify + custom checkout flows with localized bundles and shipping calculators.</li>
    <li>Lifecycle automation that synced email, SMS, and community updates.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Learning</h2>
  <p>The project validated cultural curiosity as an acquisition lever, leading to a new content funnel I now reuse in subsequent commerce experiments.</p>
