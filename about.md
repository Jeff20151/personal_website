About Jeff Chunag │

## Profile

I graduated from NTU’s Department of Biochemical Science and Technology and now pursue research at NTU’s Graduate Institute of Biomedical Electronics and Bioinformatics while serving with NTU d.school. My process follows first principles: define irreducible questions, design lean hypotheses, and let results steer product and venture decisions. In research, I focus on biomedical data with generative/contrastive models designed for reproducibility and evaluation. As co-founder of PresenterAI I translate academic inputs into generative presentations; in commerce I run cross-border automation loops to chase product–market fit; and in education I’ve mentored students at Hsinchu, Kang Chiao, iGEM, and Biodesign Challenge to connect science, startups, and creative practice.
