I graduated from National Taiwan University (BST) and am now pursuing a Graduate degree in Biomedical Electronics & Bioinformatics (BEBI), with the long-term goal of becoming a researcher who makes meaningful contributions to the world. Since 2025, I have also been a member of NTU d.school, actively engaging in interdisciplinary innovation.
