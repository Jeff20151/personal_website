A three-day sprint to validate a new product concept:

1. **Signals** — Pulled promising clips from TikTok Creative Center, sourced three suppliers on 1688, and cross-checked demand with Google Trends.
2. **Landing** — Built a Shopify + GemPages funnel positioning the product as “bring night-market snacks to the world.”
3. **Traffic** — Ran Meta Ads testing product USP vs. lifestyle narratives with one-day click tracking for ROAS.
4. **Support** — Synced SMS and email automation to guarantee responses within 12 hours.

Result: The first purchases came from the Threads community, not paid media. Next sprint focuses on sharpening the Instagram content funnel and prepping a second retargeting wave.
