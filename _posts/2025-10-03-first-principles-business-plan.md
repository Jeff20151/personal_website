Every good business plan is really a proof. A founder is claiming that capital inserted at time *t* will compound into value that exceeds the investor’s opportunity cost. If the document does not make that equation obvious, it does not matter how gorgeous the deck looks. Here is my first-principles checklist for rewriting a business plan so it answers one question: **why should anyone trade their scarce dollars for your execution?**

## 1. Define the invariant

Strip the narrative to the non-negotiables:

- **Customer delta** — In a single sentence, quantify the revenue gained, cost reduced, or risk removed for your buyer. If it is not measurable, it is marketing copy.
- **Edge that survives contact** — Name the capability competitors cannot copy without re-architecting their stack, team, or regulatory position.
- **Capital requirement** — State how much money is needed to unlock that edge. “Runway” is meaningless; list the milestones capital buys.

Write these as an executive summary first. You now have the beginning *and* the north star for the rest of the plan.

## 2. Build the model before the prose

A business plan is a model in paragraph form. Build the tables, formulas, and code first; then translate:

```text
if growth_claimed > growth_verified:
    rewrite_assumptions()
```

- Tie every projection to the assumption that generates it. Change the assumption, auto-update the output, and annotate the delta. Investors want to see your thinking, not your formatting skills.
- Run three scenarios (best, base, worst) and keep the logic explicit. If cash turns negative, spell out the contingency trigger.
- Separate profit from cash: free cash flow is the variable lenders and VCs price risk on.

## 3. Treat objections as requirements

Before the investor asks, you should:

- Quantify the competitive landscape brutally. Lagging slideware with “no real competitors” is a disqualifier.
- State the biggest risk and your mitigation plan. Uncertainty acknowledged is credibility earned.
- List the advisors or mercenaries you will pay to fill skill gaps. Lone-wolf heroics scare capital allocators.

## 4. Turn narrative into direct response copy

The plan is a direct-sales letter aimed at the investor’s wallet. Use the same discipline you would in a performance funnel:

- Hook them in three sentences. That is your executive summary.
- Sequence information so each section answers “what should I feel?” then “what should I do?”
- End with the ask: amount, terms, and the build sequence you will execute.

## 5. Rehearse the interrogation

A business plan is worthless if you cannot defend it live. I prep with this loop:

1. Write down the five questions that would kill the deal if you fumbled them.
2. Script answers with data and precedent—not vibes.
3. Stress test with the harshest operator you can find.

**Founder’s reminder:** Your job is not to impress; it is to make the investor’s decision algorithm converge to “fund.” Treat the plan as a minimal proof, keep it current, and it becomes a tool you can re-run every quarter—not a PDF you only touch when raising.
